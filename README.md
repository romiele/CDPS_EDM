This repository contains the CDPS for score-based EDM model (Karras et al. 2025), proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809. 
The code is ready to work with the data in "Test models", for conditioning using Well logs and Seismic data. 
The main file, CDPS_inversion.py is to be used, fill in the parameters within this file and run for inversion. 

Wether you need any support or question, contact me at roberto.miele@unil.ch , I'll be happy to help.

Currently, the CDPS for DDIM and DDPM, and the training dataset for the Diffusion model are available under request (Again, contact me at roberto.miele@unil.ch)
